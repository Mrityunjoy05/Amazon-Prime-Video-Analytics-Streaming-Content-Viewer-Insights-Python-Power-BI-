# Amazon Prime Video Analytics: Exploring Streaming Content & Viewer Insights â€“ Python & Power BI

## Project Summary
With the rapid expansion of the streaming industry, Amazon Prime Video has become one of the leading platforms, offering a vast and diverse content library. This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the available content to uncover trends, regional availability, and viewer preferences, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimizing content curation and audience engagement. In addition to Python-based EDA, the project leverages Power BI to create interactive dashboards that visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for deeper insights.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises two key files:

- **titles.csv:** Contains over 9,000 unique titles with information such as show type, genres, production countries, IMDb ratings, and release years.
- **credits.csv:** Includes more than 124,000 records of actors and directors, mapping them to their respective titles.

The dataset includes both categorical (e.g., genres, production countries) and numerical (e.g., IMDb scores, runtime) attributes, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of Amazon Prime's content library.

## Analysis Approach
The project follows a structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach using Python and Pandas to uncover trends and patterns within the dataset. Various aspects such as content type distribution, regional production trends, genre popularity, and IMDb ratings are analyzed using Pandas dataframes and visualized for insights.

In parallel, Power BI is used to transform these insights into interactive visualizations. The dashboard includes **20+ KPIs** across multiple dimensions such as ratings, content popularity, genre distribution, and regional trends, providing a visually intuitive platform for decision-makers.

## Key Power BI Highlights
- **KPI Development:** Created metrics for top-rated shows, most popular genres, regional performance, and content distribution.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Developed a 4-page dashboard to allow dynamic filtering and drill-down analysis of shows, genres, and regions.  
- **Visualizations:** Incorporated a mix of charts (bar, column, line, and scatter plots) and tables to enable interactive exploration of trends.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Dashboards highlight top-performing shows, genre dominance, and regional engagement patterns, facilitating strategic decisions on content acquisition and promotion.

## Business Objective
The primary business objective of this analysis is to optimize content curation and audience engagement on Amazon Prime Video. By understanding content trends, regional preferences, and viewer ratings through both Python EDA and Power BI visualizations, Amazon can make informed decisions to enhance its content offerings and improve user satisfaction.

## Impact & Achievements
- Examined **120K+ Amazon Prime Video records** using Python and Power BI to uncover content and audience trends.  
- Conducted EDA on 120K+ records, handled columns with 50%+ missing values, and engineered 4 custom features.  
- Built **20+ KPIs in Power BI** for ratings, popularity, genre, and regional insights.  
- Developed a **4-page interactive dashboard** to highlight top shows and genre dominance.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn):** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA.  
- **Power BI:** KPI creation, interactive dashboards, and visual analytics.   

## Conclusion

By combining Python-based Pandas analysis with Power BI dashboards, this project provides a comprehensive view of Amazon Prime Video content trends, viewer engagement, and regional performance. The insights support informed decisions on content strategy, helping optimize offerings and enhance audience satisfaction.
